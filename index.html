                <p class="paragraph-style">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named
                    Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                    equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-style">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
                    that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the
                    universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
                    infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
                    swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-style">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
                    look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would
                    iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
                    beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-style">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew
                    a double box around it.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
                            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known
                            undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a
                                class="article-link-style" href="">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
                            at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
                            Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a
                                class="article-link-style" href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe
                            being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                            trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
                            proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
                            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                            comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big
                            Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
                            speculation.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
                            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
                            infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                            Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
                            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield
                            new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation
                            of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
                            ruffle space-time.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                            expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                            sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
                            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it
                            was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
                            in 10 million.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
                            expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
                            been lucky.”</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
                            worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally
                            delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor
                            at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night
                            in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
                            scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
                            telescopes.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
                            most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on
                            vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of
                            Dr. Kovac’s team, <a class="article-link-style" href="">knocked on his door with a bottle of
                                Champagne</a> to tell him the news.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
                            anything.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a
                            delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I
                            did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
                            was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,”
                            he said.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
                            inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of
                            jubilation and caution.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p class="paragraph-style">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
                            that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history
                            of science.”</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
                            and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
                            impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
                            that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the
                            Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
                            need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
                            temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite
                            and other assumptions about the universe.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
                            Krauss said.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
                            report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar
                            measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

                        <span class="article-title">Spirals in the Sky</span>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
                            cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at
                            Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
                            waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
                            sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal
                            observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
                            Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
                            the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994.
                            “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
                            radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one
                            direction rather than another.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
                            gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and
                            stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the
                            microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
                            little arrows going in spirals.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
                            differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is
                            basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent
                            a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and
                            worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

                        <span class="article-title">A Special Time</span>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
                            Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break
                            point in the evolution of the universe.</p>


                    </div>
                    <p class="paragraph-style">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those
                        are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its
                        earliest, hottest moments.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
                        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of
                        physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
                        temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly
                        freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
                        long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind
                        of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
                        repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
                        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
                        grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph-style">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
                        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
                        observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said
                        that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be
                        the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="paragraph-style">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
                            from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as
                            our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will
                            continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
                            multiverse.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
                            bother asking about going any deeper into the past.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
                            beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and
                            randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph-style">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
                            Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
